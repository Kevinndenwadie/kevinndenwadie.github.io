## Job Market Paper
<ins>Informality and Monetary Policy Revisited: The Role of Endogenous Separations</ins>
>**Abstract:** Using the case of Mexico, I identify a new channel through which informality alters monetary policy transmission in developing economies. I demonstrate that the presence of an informal sector increases the probability of firm-worker match severance by a factor of 1.5 following a contractionary monetary surprise, primarily driven by the worker's informal outside option. This channel remains hidden in existing literature, relying on exogenous separation rates, thereby bypassing the endogenous severance decisions between firms and workers. Motivated by empirical patterns illustrated by a VAR model calibrated to Mexico, I develop a New Keynesian DSGE model featuring a dual labor market: a formal sector characterized by search-and-matching frictions, price and wage rigidities, and endogenous job destruction based on idiosyncratic match productivity and a fully competitive informal sector. I show that idiosyncratic productivity on its own introduces an amplification mechanism for job destruction, accelerating labor flows from the formal to the informal labor market.
